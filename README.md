This is a simple, clean personal portfolio website built with PHP, HTML, SCSS and vanilla JavaScript.

Itâ€™s based on an original design by me. The goal of this project is to turn a static design into accessible, modern code â€” and make it easy for anyone to customize or learn from. Itâ€™s mobile responsive and includes a custom CSS masonry layout, on scroll animation effects and a JavaScript filter.

_This project is part of a free, open-source series focused on helping newer developers practice HTML/CSS with real-world examples._
